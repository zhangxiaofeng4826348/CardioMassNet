Given the excellent performance of the U-Net architecture in various medical segmentation tasks, this study designed a dual-task deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based on the classic U-Net architecture, balancing both segmentation and classification tasks. This architecture, the CardioMass-Net architecture, consists of three main components: the classic U-Net architecture; a global feature extraction module; and a dual-branch output layer. This framework enables automatic segmentation of lesion boundaries and classification of lesion properties, i.e., thrombus (T) vs. non-thrombus (NT), within a single network, thereby improving the model's ability to recognize complex echocardiograms.
